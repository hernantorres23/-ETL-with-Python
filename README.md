It is a small part of a project made some years ago, the target was to take files from various sources on-premises until the chief apply the stop following a planner.  

The architecture is cumbersome because there are a lot of companies inside the project some of them use the same administrative system but with a different account tree, and in addition between companies had the same name with a different number.  

Besides all, some companies do not have an internet connection they will need a desktop interface to perform the process, in this country still exists this problem frequently, and I happy had started the process with SharePoint advantages.   

In the end, it was a successful project where the main company finally can consolidate all information in hierarchy reports displaying:
* Balance Sheet, 
* Profit and Loss, 
* and Cash Flow.  

The tools were:
* SQL Server (Microsoft Dynamics), 
* Python (pandas, "sharepy", 
* Flask and others), 
* Visual Basic, 
* Microsoft Access.
